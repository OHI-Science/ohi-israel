# Global OHI vs. Local OHI+ Scores Comparison

**A comparison of OHI scores for  from and OHI+ scores for .**

View the table [here](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohi-israel/master/med2014/reports/compare_scores_OHIplus_global.html), which displays 2014 global assessment OHI scores (for Israel), Israel OHI+ scores, and the differences between them (global - Israel). The differences are colored from blue to red, with dark blue indicating the largest positive difference and red indicating the largest negative difference. 

OHI+ scores are calculated based on the best available local information, which is incorporated as inputs, goal models, and reference points. The purpose of OHI+ assessments is to customize the OHI framework methodology to best represent the local context being assessed, which can mean different visions of what a healthy ocean is and what it should provide. This makes OHI+ scores not directly comparable to scores calculated in the global assessments, which are based on coarser-scale information, models, and reference points. However, the table can help clarify which goal scores and therefore methodolgies differed the most between the assessments. Because of the local information included, OHI+ assessments should be used for within-country decision making, and global scores should be used to compare global comparisons.
